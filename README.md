# TravelingSalesman
Python implementations of three basic TSP algorithms

This repo contains implementations of three basic algorithms for solving the traveling salesman problem. The algorithms used are: nearest neighbor, 2-swap (aka random walk) and simulated annealing.

The simulated annealing implementation is not perfect, as the solutions obtained seem to vary more than desired and are not close to optimal for smaller inputs. But it works, kinda.

To run the driver program, type `python main.py`.
